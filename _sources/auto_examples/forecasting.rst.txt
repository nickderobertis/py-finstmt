Forecasting Financial Statements with ``finstmt``
=================================================

    Note: The plots are not coming through and the formatting of the
    statements is off in the web view. Download the Jupyter notebook for
    the full experience.

First import the necessary classes and ``pandas``.


.. code-block:: default


    import os
    os.chdir('..')
    from finstmt import FinancialStatements, IncomeStatements, BalanceSheets
    import pandas as pd









Load Financial Statements
-------------------------



.. code-block:: default


    root_folder = os.path.sep.join(['..', 'tests', 'sources', 'stockrow', 'CAT'])

    inc_path = os.path.join(root_folder, 'annual_income.csv')
    bs_path = os.path.join(root_folder, 'annual_bs.csv')

    inc_df = pd.read_csv(inc_path, index_col=0)
    bs_df = pd.read_csv(bs_path, index_col=0)

    bs = BalanceSheets.from_df(bs_df)
    inc = IncomeStatements.from_df(inc_df)
    stmts = FinancialStatements(inc, bs)

Copy the Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set up for running multiple forecasts off the same data, you can make
a copy of it using ``copy.deepcopy``. Then any adjustments to the
configuration will only be in the original object and not the copy.



.. code-block:: default


    from copy import deepcopy

    stmts2 = deepcopy(stmts)









Run a Forecast
--------------


Set the Default Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is not a necessary step, but this is the way to change the default
forecast method. The default is already ``cagr`` and so this doesn't
actually have an effect.



.. code-block:: default


    stmts.config.update_all(['forecast_config', 'method'], 'cagr')









View the Forecast Assumptions
-----------------------------

All the assumptions going into the forecast are in
``forecast_assumptions``:



.. code-block:: default


    stmts.forecast_assumptions







.. only:: builder_html

    .. raw:: html

Run the First Forecast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Forecasts are run using ``.forecast()`` and produce
``ForecastedFinancialStatements``. It is usually good practice to first
run a forecast, then view the results, then adjust as needed.

And the plot:

    fcst.plot()






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    <Figure size 1500x4800 with 48 Axes>



It is also possible to plot a subset. Let's focus on only a few items
for sake of example.



.. code-block:: default


    fcst.plot(subset=['revenue', 'cogs', 'cash'])






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    <Figure size 1500x300 with 3 Axes>



Change Methods and Re-Run Forecast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After viewing the plots, the appropriate methods for forecasting each
item should be chosen. Then they can be updated.



.. code-block:: default


    stmts.config.update('cash', ['forecast_config', 'method'], 'trend')
    stmts.config.update('cogs', ['forecast_config', 'method'], 'mean')









Now re-run the forecast.



.. code-block:: default


    fcst = stmts.forecast()






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

And plot the results:



.. code-block:: default


    fcst.plot(subset=['revenue', 'cogs', 'cash'])






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    <Figure size 1500x300 with 3 Axes>



Now the methods for those forecasts has been updated.

Adjusting an Existing Forecast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While it is possible to use the ``manual`` forecast type and pass in the
desired growth rates or levels from the beginning, it is often more
convenient to first run the forecast, then simply adjust it. The
``.to_manual`` method of the forecast was added for this purpose.

Either ``adjustments`` or ``replacements`` can be passed while updating,
and either the level of the item or the growth in the item can be used
for the new manual forecast. For either one, a dictionary where the keys
are the index of the period and values are the adjustment/replacement or
a list containing all the adjustment/replacements can be used.



.. code-block:: default


    fcst.forecasts['cash'].to_manual(adjustments={0: 0.4})  # boost first forecast period cash growth by 40%
    fcst.forecasts['cogs'].to_manual(use_levels=True, replacements=[0.85 for _ in range(5)])  # use 85% of sales for full COGS forecast
    fcst.forecasts['revenue'].to_manual(use_levels=True, replacements={1: 8e10})  # set second forecast period revenue to 80,000,000,000









Then just run the forecast again to get everything updated in the
statements. Then you can view the plots:



.. code-block:: default


    fcst = stmts.forecast()
    fcst.plot(subset=['revenue', 'cogs', 'cash'])






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

A Second Forecast
-----------------

Since we earlier did a ``deepcopy`` of the ``stmts`` object, that still
has the original forecast assumptions and can be used for a separate
forecast.
